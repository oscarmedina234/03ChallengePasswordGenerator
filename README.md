Employees looked like they were in need of a solution to generate secure passwords. I built it to make it easy for employees to generate random passwords. It makes it easier for employees to randomly generate passwords with specific criteria. I learned how to use prompts, confirms, and alerts to create a password then use the math.random feature to randomly select the variables. 

## Usage

You can use this to generate random passwords given select criteria.
